# Modelling_Risk_using_feed_forward_NNET_and_RNNs_LSTM

This is my portfolio project for Statistical Modelling. My work is based on the work of Dr. Sager from the University of Texas at Austin.
I take his approach of modelling risk and implement it using Neural Networks. Please read the paper (PDF file) for more detail.
